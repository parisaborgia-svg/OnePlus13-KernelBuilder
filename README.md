# OnePlus 13 Kernel Builder

[![Build OnePlus 13 Kernel](https://github.com/Hipuu/OnePlus13-KernelBuilder/actions/workflows/build-oneplus13-kernel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Hipuu/OnePlus13-KernelBuilder/actions/workflows/build-oneplus13-kernel.yml)

GitHub Actions workflow that builds custom **OnePlus 13** (SM8750 / "sun") kernels with KernelSU / KernelSU-Next, SUSFS, and NetHunter wireless drivers.

Built on the [WildKernels/OnePlus_KernelSU_SUSFS](https://github.com/WildKernels/OnePlus_KernelSU_SUSFS) pipeline, vendored at a pinned commit and specialized to a single device. Produces a flashable AnyKernel3 ZIP, a raw kernel `Image`, and a loadable wireless-module pack.

## Features

| **Toolchain** | Pinned ZyC Clang 19 or manifest Clang; `O2`/`O3`; `thin`/`full`/`none` LTO |
| **CI** | Six kernel variants buildable in parallel, ccache-accelerated, artifact / prerelease / release publishing |

### Wireless adapter support

Drivers are built as modules and shipped in `kernel_modules_*.zip`:

| Vendor | Drivers |
|--------|---------|
| Atheros | `ath9k_htc`, `ath10k_usb`, `carl9170` |
| Realtek | `rtl8187`, `rtl8xxxu`, `rtw88` (out-of-tree, [lwfinger/rtw88](https://github.com/lwfinger/rtw88)) |
| Ralink | `rt2500usb`, `rt73usb`, `rt2800usb` |
| MediaTek | `mt7601u`, `mt76x0u`, `mt76x2u`, `mt7921u` |
| Zydas / Intersil | `zd1211rw`, `p54usb` |
| Virtual | `mac80211_hwsim` |

## Not included

| `kernel_modules_<MODEL>_<OS>_<KERNEL>.zip` | Wireless/CAN modules, `modules.dep`, `nethunter-wifi.sh` |
| `Nethunter-Wireless-Firmware-<VER>.zip` | Firmware blobs (passthrough) |

## Installation

1. Flash the AnyKernel3 ZIP via custom recovery, KernelSU, APatch, or another flasher.
2. Reboot and install the matching manager app — [KernelSU-Next](https://github.com/KernelSU-Next/KernelSU-Next/releases) or [KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU/releases).

## Wireless modules

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Modules are built with `CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y`. A module pack loads **only** on the exact kernel build it shipped with — matching base versions is not sufficient.

Extract `kernel_modules_*.zip` on the device, extract the firmware ZIP, and run the bundled loader as root:

```bash
./nethunter-wifi.sh load            # load default driver (ath9k_htc)
./nethunter-wifi.sh load mt76x2u    # or any driver in the pack
./nethunter-wifi.sh list            # list available drivers
./nethunter-wifi.sh status          # resident modules, PHYs, regdomain
./nethunter-wifi.sh monitor         # monitor mode, auto-detected interface
./nethunter-wifi.sh monitor "" 6    # monitor mode on channel 6
./nethunter-wifi.sh managed         # leave monitor mode
./nethunter-wifi.sh restore         # unload and restore internal Wi-Fi
./nethunter-wifi.sh install         # autoload at boot (KernelSU/Magisk)
./nethunter-wifi.sh uninstall       # remove boot service
```

`load` walks the shipped `modules.dep` to resolve dependency order, displaces the platform Wi-Fi stack when the driver requires `mac80211`, and points the firmware loader at the directory holding the NetHunter blobs.

### Behavior to expect

- **Loading a `mac80211` driver disables the internal Wi-Fi.** This is unavoidable on this device — see [why the drivers are not built in](#why-the-drivers-are-not-built-in). Drivers that do not pull in `mac80211` (for example `slcan`) leave it alone.
- **`restore` reloads the platform modules, but Android's `WifiService` usually stays latched in a failed state.** Reboot to get internal Wi-Fi back reliably.
- **`install` costs the internal Wi-Fi on every boot.** Undo with `uninstall`.
- **The radio runs in the world regulatory domain.** See [regulatory database](#regulatory-database).

### Tested adapters

| Adapter | USB ID | Driver | Result |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Atheros AR9271 | `040d:3801` | `ath9k_htc` | Firmware load, `phy0`, managed + **monitor** + AP modes, frame capture confirmed |

> [!WARNING]
> This pipeline's kernel did not boot on a real, retail CPH2655 global unit
> in our own testing (`OP13-CPH-6.6.56`, exact stock-kernel-version match) —
> two flash attempts, including a properly `magiskboot`-repacked image with
> a valid AVB footer and verification disabled, both failed with what looks
> like a genuine KMI/vendor-module incompatibility, not a signing issue. The
> adapter result above has not been independently reproduced by us on that
> device as a result. See [REAL-DEVICE-REPORT.md](REAL-DEVICE-REPORT.md) for
> the full writeup, including what *did* work on that hardware (a from-scratch
> OnePlusOSS source build).

Verified against the 6.6.118 A16 build. Reported PHY capabilities: IBSS, managed, AP, AP/VLAN, monitor, P2P-client, P2P-GO.

### Regulatory database

Android ships no `regulatory.db`, so `cfg80211` logs `failed to load regulatory.db` and falls back to the world domain (`country 00`):

- 20 dBm cap on all channels
- Channels 12–14 flagged `no IR` — injection and beaconing blocked there
- 5 GHz entirely `PASSIVE-SCAN`
- `iw reg set <CC>` is accepted but has no effect

Channels 1–11 remain fully usable, injection included.

To lift the restriction, install `regulatory.db` and `regulatory.db.p7s` from [wireless-regdb](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sforshee/wireless-regdb.git) into a directory `ueventd` searches. A KernelSU/Magisk module overlaying `system/etc/firmware/` is the practical route — the same mechanism the NetHunter firmware ZIP uses.

<details>
<summary>Why setting <code>firmware_class/parameters/path</code> is not enough</summary>

A direct kernel load from `/data` fails with `-2` under SELinux (`shell_data_file` is not readable by the firmware loader). Such loads only succeed because ueventd's usermode helper subsequently searches its own fixed list, defined in `/system/etc/ueventd.rc`:

```
/etc/firmware/  /odm/firmware/  /data/vendor/firmware/update/  /vendor/firmware/
/firmware/image/  /vendor/firmware_mnt/image/qca6490/  /data/oplus/fw_update/
/mnt/vendor/persist/copy/  /mnt/vendor/persist/  /odm/etc/wifi/  /vendor/firmware_mnt/image/
```

The blob must land in one of those paths.
</details>

### Why the drivers are not built in

`ath9k_htc` is `depends on USB && MAC80211`, and Kconfig forbids a built-in driver depending on a modular provider. `CONFIG_ATH9K_HTC=y` therefore forces `CONFIG_MAC80211=y`, `CONFIG_CFG80211=y` and `CONFIG_RFKILL=y`.

That is fatal on this device. OnePlus builds its own `cfg80211` in a separate tree with different symbol CRCs — the bundled `mac80211` already refuses to load against the platform one (`disagrees about version of symbol wiphy_new_nm`). With `cfg80211` compiled into the Image, `/vendor/lib/modules/cfg80211.ko` cannot load at all, `qca_cld3_peach_v2` fails its CRC check on every boot, and the internal Wi-Fi is permanently dead.

Keeping the drivers modular confines that cost to the moment the loader runs, and a reboot undoes it.

<details>
<summary>Manual load procedure (what the loader automates)</summary>

Both `cfg80211.ko` **and** `mac80211.ko` must come from the pack — the platform pair is CRC-incompatible with these drivers.

```bash
# Turn Wi-Fi off in Settings first, then unload the stock stack
rmmod qca_cld3_peach_v2
rmmod cfg80211

# Load the bundled stack
insmod ./cfg80211.ko
insmod ./mac80211.ko

# Load the driver chain (example: ath9k_htc)
insmod ./ath.ko
insmod ./ath9k_hw.ko
insmod ./ath9k_common.ko
insmod ./ath9k_htc.ko
```

See EmberHeart's `docs/drivers.md` for per-driver dependency chains.

## How it works

The OnePlus 13 kernel needs WildKernels' manifest fork, pinned source/toolchain revisions, and a specific patch ordering. Rather than reimplement ~2400 lines of that pipeline and risk drift, this repository vendors it from commit `bfe12144` (with `WildKernels/kernel_patches` pinned to `24865a0`) and changes only what standalone single-device operation requires:

- Internal sub-action references point at this repository's copies.
- Source sync pulls pinned Clang, kernel build-tools and AnyKernel3 from WildKernels' public `toolchain-cache` release, so no per-repository toolchain mirror is needed.
- A thin workflow exposes only OnePlus 13 options.
- The KernelSU ref is resolved to a commit SHA before building. KernelSU-Next's `setup.sh` checks out the *latest tag* when given no argument, and that tag lags the SUSFS patch set — `10_enable_susfs_for_ksu.patch` expects a `kernel/Kconfig` that only exists on `dev`, leaving an unfixable `kernel/Kconfig.rej`.

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for validation, build profiles, and debugging.
